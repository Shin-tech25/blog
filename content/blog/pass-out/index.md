## Meaning

"Pass out" is a phrasal verb with two primary meanings: (1) to faint or lose consciousness temporarily, and (2) to distribute something to a group of people (e.g., papers or samples).

## Grammar and Usage

- Part of speech: phrasal verb (verb + particle).
- Transitivity:

  - In the sense "to faint": **intransitive** — no direct object. (e.g., "She passed out.")
  - In the sense "to distribute": **transitive** — takes a direct object. (e.g., "They passed out flyers.")

- Typical structures:

  - \[subject] + **pass out**. (intransitive: She passed out.)
  - \[subject] + **pass out** + \[object]. (transitive: The teacher passed out the exam.)

- Variations and related particles:

  - **pass someone out** — rarely used in modern English to mean cause someone to faint (more common: "knock someone out"); usually avoid this phrasing for clarity.
  - When used reflexively in some dialects: "pass oneself out" is unusual — don't use.
