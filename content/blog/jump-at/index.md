## Meaning

"Jump at" is a phrasal verb meaning to accept an opportunity, offer, or suggestion eagerly and without hesitation.

## Grammar and Usage

- Part of speech: phrasal verb (verb + particle).
- Transitivity: typically transitive — followed by a noun or noun phrase (object).
- Typical pattern: **jump at + (the) + noun** (e.g., _jump at the chance/opportunity/idea_).
- Usage notes:

  - Often used to show positive eagerness: _He jumped at the chance to travel._
  - Can be followed by a clause when the noun is implied: _I would have jumped at it._
  - Register: neutral to informal; common in spoken and written English.

- Variations with particles/prepositions: the meaning changes with context — here "at" conveys immediate enthusiastic acceptance; do not confuse with physical meanings of "jump" (e.g., _jump at someone_ meaning to attack or react suddenly).
