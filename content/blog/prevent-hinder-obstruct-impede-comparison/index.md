## Overall Meaning

All four verbs deal with **blocking, slowing, or stopping** movement, progress, or action.
The difference lies in **degree, intentionality, and effect**.

## 1. Hinder

- **Nuance**: To make progress more difficult, but not necessarily stop it. It suggests interference or inconvenience.
- **Connotation**: Relatively **mild**, often indirect.
- **Typical use**: growth, progress, communication, development.
- **Example**:

  - _The noise outside hindered my concentration._
  - _Lack of resources hinders innovation._

## 2. Obstruct

- **Nuance**: To block the way, either physically or figuratively. Stronger than _hinder_.

- **Typical use**: obstruct justice, obstruct a view, obstruct traffic.
- **Example**:

  - _The parked car obstructed the road._
  - _The witness tried to obstruct justice by hiding evidence._

## 3. Prevent

- **Nuance**: To stop something from happening **before it occurs**.
- **Connotation**: Active avoidance, **total stop**. Often positive (safety, protection).
- **Typical use**: prevent accidents, prevent crime, prevent someone from doing something.
- **Example**:

  - _Vaccination helps prevent disease._
  - _The guard prevented the child from entering the building._

## 4. Impede

- **Nuance**: To slow down or delay progress, similar to _hinder_ but slightly more formal and heavier.
- **Connotation**: Often used in official or academic contexts, implies **friction or drag**.
- **Typical use**: impede progress, impede recovery, impede investigation.
