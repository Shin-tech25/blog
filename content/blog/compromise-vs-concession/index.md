## Summary

**Compromise** means mutual adjustment where both sides give up something to reach an agreement.
Whereas, **Concession** means a one-sided yield, where only one party gives ground.
The key difference is balance: compromise is cooperative, concession is unilateral.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect           | Compromise                             | Concession                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**      | Both sides make adjustments            | One side yields or grants something       |
| **Direction**    | Mutual, two-way                        | Unilateral, one-way                       |
| **Tone**         | Neutral or positive, cooperative       | Reluctant, pressured, or generous         |

| **Expressions**  | _reach/strike a compromise_            | _make/grant a concession_, _concede that_ |

## Core Difference

A **compromise** is reached when two or more sides move closer to each other. Everyone sacrifices part of their original demand to achieve a balanced result.
A **concession**, however, is made when only one side gives something up—whether reluctantly under pressure or voluntarily as a sign of goodwill.

## Nuance and Tone

- **Compromise** usually carries a neutral or positive nuance. It suggests fairness, cooperation, and practicality.
- **Concession** can sound weaker, as if one side lost ground, but it may also suggest generosity or strategic calculation.
- Be aware that _compromise_ as a verb has another meaning: _to weaken or endanger_ (e.g., _compromise security_).

## Typical Expressions

- **Compromise**: _reach a compromise_, _strike a compromise_, _compromise on price/terms_
- **Concession**: _make a concession_, _grant a concession_, _as a concession to someone_, _concede that…_

## Examples

- _Both sides reached a **compromise** on working hours._
- _The supplier made a **concession** by offering free delivery._
- _They compromised on the design to meet the deadline._
- _As a concession to residents, the city reduced noise at night._
